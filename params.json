Truly Disruptive Technology.\r\n\r\n* A privacy flaw in most smartphones allows anyone with $35 and a bit of programming knowledge to build an automated surveillance system that tracks your movements without your consent. Many corporations and governments are now listening.\r\n* Shenanigans is a community-powered network of portable WiFi devices that scrambles surveillance systems by impersonating the smartphones and laptops of everyone who volunteers. As more people join in, these tracking systems will stop yielding useful information. To the trackers, everyone will be everywhere.\r\n* Shenanigans is open-source software, and relies on the popular OpenWRT Linux distribution. The identity rebroadcaster runs on off-the-shelf portable wireless routers that cost around $25-$35, such as the WRTNode or the TP-LINK MR3040. If you already have a device, you can get started now!\r\n\r\n##PARTICIPATE\r\n\r\n* Be everywhere! Download the Shenanigans OS X app and submit your own wireless identity for worldwide rebroadcast.\r\n* You can also build your own mobile identity rebroadcaster. Download and install Shenanigans on your own device, and take it on a stroll through a city, mall, museum, or airport to degrade the quality of data gathered by tracking systems.\r\n\r\n##PROJECT GOALS\r\n\r\nWe're just getting started. Help us reach these goals:\r\n* 5 of 10,000 WiFi fingerprints submitted\r\n* 4 of 1,000 mobile rebroadcasting units worldwide\r\n* 0m of 100m total identity rebroadcasts\r\n\r\n##ABOUT\r\n\r\nShenanigans was created by David Allan Rueter, an artist and programmer based in Chicago, IL, USA.\r\nhttp://davidrueter.com \r\n@davruet\r\nIf you want us to keep you posted on the status of this project, please join our mailing list.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
